--- Nitobi Grid V3
-------------------

You will need to set up a few datatables in MYSQL for some of these demos to run (including this one). Please use the SQL syntax file "NitobiSampleDatabases.sql" in the root of the demo folder. 

Then in each of 
- load_data.php
- save_data.php
- lookuphandler.php (for grids with lookup fields)
- getnextrecord.php (in some of the demos that use key handlers)
- allocaterecord.php (in the remotedata/ sample)

you will need to change the database connection string.
